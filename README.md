* This scene processes images to obfuscate sensitive information.

* **Important**: If you are connected to **IPLeiria wi-fi** or by the **IPLeiria VPN**, you can use the SafeAR service running at IPLeiria's server. If is not possible to connect to this VPN or wi-fi, you should configure your own [SafeAR](https://github.com/ipleiria-ciic/safe-ar/) server.

### 2. Tutorial Scene
